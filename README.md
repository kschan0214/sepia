## Introduction  

**SEPIA** is a tool providing a graphical user interface to build data processing pipeline of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in Matlab.

The current GUI version is built to access the following toolboxes:
- [MEDI (updated Jan 15, 2020)](http://weill.cornell.edu/mri/pages/qsm.html), 
- [STI Suite (v3.0)](https://chunleiliulab.github.io/software.html),
- [FANSI (v3.0, released on 2021.10.15, i.e., commit b6ac1c9e)](https://gitlab.com/cmilovic/FANSI-toolbox/-/tree/b6ac1c9ea03380722ebe25a6dbef33fff4ea3700),  
- [SEGUE](https://xip.uclb.com/i/software/SEGUE.html), and 
- [nonlinear dipole inversion (NDI)](https://github.com/polakd/NDI_Toolbox),
- [mritools (ROMEO/CLEARSWI) (v3.5.5)](https://github.com/korbinian90/CompileMRI.jl/releases) (2022-Oct-11: v3.5.6 also passed),
- [MRI Susceptibility Calculation Methods, accessed 12 September 2019](https://xip.uclb.com/product/mri_qsm_tkd).

SEPIA provides two key features for QSM processing:  
1. mix-and-match methods from different toolboxes to build your own QSM processing pipeline,
2. graphical user interface to easily adjust parameters of different algorithms.

SEPIA is designed to provide a platform for easy access to different QSM processing methods in the field. To achieve this, most of the codes were written for data flow and algorithm parameter control. Through SEPIA, we hope researchers who are not expert in QSM will also be able to use QSM for their research.
